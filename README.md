Integration of Mamba and Transformer– MAT for  Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting using Rust

## Introduction
This is an implementation of the paper arxiv.2409.08530v1

 Abstract—Long-short range time series forecasting is essential
 for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods.
 While deep learning models such as Transformers have made
 significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often
 encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and
 effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state space
 model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling
 of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance
 between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This
 article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both
 Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined
 approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to
 capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evo
lutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT
 harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and
 the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental
 results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT
 outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction
 accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.

 ## Implementation Summary
### Key Features Integrated:
- Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN): Preprocesses and reverses the normalization of input data.
- Two-Stage Embedding: Reduces the dimensionality of input data to improve efficiency.
- Multi-Scale Context Extraction: Convolves the input sequence at multiple temporal scales to capture context.
- Mamba Module: Handles long-range dependencies using a basic state-space model.
- Transformer Module: Captures short-range dependencies with multi-head self-attention.
- Residual Connections: Helps maintain gradient flow and enhance model depth.
- Two-Stage Projection: Projects the fused outputs back to the original time series dimension.
- Custom Loss Function (Optional): A weighted combination of MSE and MAE to balance short-term and long-term predictions.
- Selective Scanning in Mamba  (Optional): The Mamba module currently implements a basic state-space model, but the selective scanning mechanism, which modulates interactions contextually and filters irrelevant information, is missing. This is enhanced by adding a gating mechanism or a learned selection layer to the Mamba module.
